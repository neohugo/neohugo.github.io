      <description>Editions Hugo is available in two editions: standard and extended. With the extended edition you can:
Encode to the WebP format when processing images. You can decode WebP images with either edition. Transpile Sass to CSS using the embedded LibSass transpiler. The extended edition is not required to use the Dart Sass transpiler. We recommend that you install the extended edition.
Prerequisites Although not required in all cases, Git, Go, and Dart Sass are commonly used when working with Hugo.</description>
